        <p>Aside from my studies, I have a passion for Calisthenics.</p>

        <h3>Calisthenics</h3>
        <p>Calisthenics is not just a workout; it's a lifestyle. As a passionate practitioner, I engage in bodyweight exercises that focus on strength, flexibility, and control. Calisthenics allows me to explore the incredible capabilities of the human body through movements like pull-ups, push-ups, dips, and various advanced skills.</p>
        <p>Embracing calisthenics goes beyond physical benefits; it fosters discipline, perseverance, and a strong mind-body connection. Whether it's mastering a new skill or achieving personal fitness goals, calisthenics continues to inspire me on my journey towards a healthier and more resilient lifestyle.</p>
